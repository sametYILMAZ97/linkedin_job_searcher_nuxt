| 1.x.x   | ‚ùå |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### üîí Private Disclosure

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities publicly.** Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to [your-email@example.com]
2. **Subject**: Use "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
3. **Response Time**: We'll respond within 48 hours
4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days

### üìù What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type**: XSS, CSRF, injection, etc.
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the application
- **Reproduction Steps**: How to reproduce the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential damage or exploitation
- **Proof of Concept**: If available (screenshots, code)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for resolution

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Scope

#### In Scope

- Client-side vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- Server-side rendering issues
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Configuration security issues
- Data validation problems
- Authentication/authorization bypasses

#### Out of Scope

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- LinkedIn platform vulnerabilities
- Browser-specific security issues
- Rate limiting bypasses (we use LinkedIn's public APIs)

## üîê Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **XSS Prevention**: Content is properly escaped
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Nuxt CSRF protection
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular npm audit checks
- **TypeScript**: Type safety prevents many common vulnerabilities
- **No Sensitive Data**: No API keys or secrets in the codebase

### Security Headers

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    routeRules: {
      '/**': {
        headers: {
          'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
          'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
          'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
          'Permissions-Policy': 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Content Security Policy

```typescript
// Implemented CSP headers
'Content-Security-Policy': [
  "default-src 'self'",
  "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
  "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
  "img-src 'self' data: https:",
  "connect-src 'self' https://www.linkedin.com"
].join('; ')
```

## üö® Common Vulnerabilities

### Prevented Issues

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - All user inputs are sanitized
   - Vue's template system prevents injection
   - No `innerHTML` usage with user data

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - Nuxt's built-in CSRF protection
   - State management prevents unauthorized actions

3. **Injection Attacks**
   - TypeScript prevents many injection vectors
   - No direct database queries (client-side only)
   - URL parameters are properly encoded

4. **Information Disclosure**
   - No sensitive data in localStorage
   - No API keys in client-side code
   - Error messages don't expose internal details

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scan
npm audit

# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# TypeScript compilation (prevents some vulnerabilities)
npm run type-check

# Lint security patterns
npm run lint
```

### Manual Security Testing

- Input validation testing
- XSS payload testing
- CSRF token verification
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization check verification

## üìã Security Checklist

### For Contributors

- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Escape output properly
- [ ] Use TypeScript for type safety
- [ ] Avoid `eval()` or similar dynamic execution
- [ ] Don't commit secrets or API keys
- [ ] Test with security mindset
- [ ] Follow principle of least privilege

### For Deployment

- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Set up CSP policies
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Monitor for security alerts
- [ ] Backup and recovery plan

## üîÑ Incident Response

### If a Security Issue is Discovered

1. **Immediate Assessment**
   - Evaluate the severity and impact
   - Determine if immediate action is needed
   - Document the issue privately

2. **Communication**
   - Notify the security team
   - Prepare public disclosure timeline
   - Draft security advisory

3. **Resolution**
   - Develop and test the fix
   - Deploy emergency patch if critical
   - Update documentation

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct security review
   - Update security practices
   - Share lessons learned

## üìû Contact Information

- **Security Email**: [your-email@example.com]
- **Response Time**: 48 hours
- **Public PGP Key**: [Link to PGP key if available]
